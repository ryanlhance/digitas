# Digitas Fit Map

A single, shareable web page that shows the **Digitas job description exactly as posted** — and lets a reader hover any highlighted phrase (it visibly becomes clickable) and click it to see the **specific, real experience** that backs it.

The intent: hand a hiring manager one link that shows fit, phrase by phrase. Every highlighted phrase simply opens the real experience behind it.

## Editing the copy — you only ever touch the content, never the code

Everything on the page (the JD text, the highlighted phrases, and the evidence behind each one) comes from **`data.json`**, which the page loads at runtime. Nothing is hardcoded in the HTML or JavaScript. To change wording, you change the content — not the code.

There are two equally valid ways to edit:

### Option A — edit `data.json` directly
Open `data.json` and edit the text. It's the file the page actually reads.

### Option B — edit `build_data.py`, then regenerate (recommended if you're comfortable)
`build_data.py` is a friendlier layout of the same content. Edit it, then run:
```bash
python3 build_data.py
```
That rewrites `data.json` for you and prints a sanity check (phrase count + any broken evidence links).

### How the content is organized

- **`evidence`** — a dictionary of your accomplishments. Each has a `title`, a `text`, and (for portfolio pieces) a `link`. One piece of evidence can back many phrases.
- **`jd_prose`** — the job description itself, in order, as a list of blocks:
  - `{"type": "p", ...}` — a paragraph
  - `{"type": "h2"/"h3", "text": "..."}` — a section heading
  - `{"type": "li", ...}` — a bullet
  - Inside a paragraph or bullet, plain text is just text; a **highlighted phrase** is an object with its own `text` and an `evidence` list of ids. That's what becomes clickable.
- **`job`** — the role title, location, the link to the live posting, the browser-tab title, and the short "Ryan Hance · Fit Map" framing line at the top.

**To add a new proof point:** add an entry to `evidence`, then add its id to the `evidence` list of whichever phrase(s) it backs. It shows up automatically — no code change.

## What's on the page

- The real Digitas posting: **Overview**, **Responsibilities**, **Qualifications** — styled to feel like the live job page (Digitas logo, colors, and typefaces).
- **Highlighted phrases** you can hover (they show a "clickable" cue) and click.
- A **side panel** (right on desktop, a bottom sheet on phones) that opens with the evidence behind the clicked phrase — an accomplishment title, the story, and a link to the case study when there is one.
- A **shareable deep link:** click a phrase and the address bar updates (e.g. `…/#p-system-thinker`); sending that link opens the page with that phrase already expanded.

## Running it on your own computer

⚠️ **Don't double-click `index.html`.** The page loads its content with `fetch()`, which browsers block on the `file://` protocol, so opening the file directly shows an error. Serve it over http instead:

```bash
# from inside this folder:
python3 serve.py 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser
```
(or `python3 -m http.server 8000` — same result.)

## Publishing it as a shareable link (GitHub Pages)

GitHub Pages serves over https, so everything works there with no changes.

1. **Create a repo and push these files to its root:**
   ```bash
   cd digitas-brainmap
   git init
   git add index.html styles.css app.js data.json digitas-logo.svg README.md build_data.py
   git commit -m "Digitas fit map"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. **Turn on Pages:** on GitHub → **Settings → Pages** → **Source: Deploy from a branch**, **Branch: `main`**, **Folder: `/ (root)`** → **Save**.
3. **Wait ~1 minute**, then open the URL Pages gives you:
   ```
   https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/
   ```
   That's the link you send. Deep links work too, e.g. `…/#p-genai`.

```
digitas-brainmap/
  index.html         # page structure (no content)
  styles.css         # Digitas brand styling + responsive
  app.js             # loads data.json and renders the page
  data.json          # ALL content — the file the page reads
  build_data.py      # optional friendly editor that regenerates data.json
  digitas-logo.svg   # Digitas logo (white, for the black top bar)
  serve.py           # optional local server (not needed on Pages)
  README.md          # this file
```

## Portfolio links

The portfolio pieces link to their public **hance.work** case-study pages. To change one, edit that evidence item's `link` in `data.json` (or `build_data.py`).
